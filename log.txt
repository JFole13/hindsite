// Stuff That Needs Changed / Bugs
Add Spacing around logo in team containers
Have dropdown arrow move with team name

Gotta look for even odds edge cases
edge cases CHI -110 DAL -110, CHI -120 DAL -110
will have to go through every function 


// Finishing Touches
Make sure spaces are consistent in css file
Make sure typing style is consistent troughout all files
Check for semicolons
Hyphens in html
Container names in html
Colors in css use hex code
Import parsing functions from another file
alphabetical in variable declaration, function call, etc.
away/home declaration is consistent
